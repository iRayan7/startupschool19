#### WEEK 1
### [Startup School 2019 Orientation](https://www.startupschool.org/videos/82)
### [How to Evaluate Startup Ideas Pt. 1](https://www.startupschool.org/videos/62)
* Startup = Growth
* A great investor will not try to poke holes in your idea, instead will try to find a way for that to become a billion dollars idea. ( A great investor will pitch your idea back to you, and try to convince you on ways to grow your company fast )
* Your startup idea is a hypothesis. Your job is to figure out how to construct this hypothesis (the pitch) to the investors so they understand how it can grow quickly. ( A common mistake is to accurately describe or over-describe different parts)
* Startup Idea:
    * **Problem**: What are the initial conditions (settings) for this company that allow it to grow quickly.
        * Good characteristics of a problem ( ways to describe your problem ):
            * Popular [1M+ users]
            * Growing -markets- [20%/ year]
            * Urgent [people have to solve it **Right Now**]
            * Expensive -to solve- [cost $B]
            * Mandatory [Laws changed]
            * frequent (very important) [Hourly] 
    * **Solution**: What is the experiment that you are running for this company to grow quickly.
        * **Don‚Äôt start here!**
            * Avoid -> SISP "Solutions In Search of a Problem‚Äù ( usually engineers get excited about a technology and tend to build something with it and then try to find a problem to solve with this solution )
    * **Insight**: Why your experiment is going to be successful.
        * **Unfair advantage.**
            * Why this solution is going to work? 
            * Why you are going to win vs everyone else?
            * Why should the investor choose you over anyone else?
            * **Related to growth.**
                * Your unfair advantage should be related to growth, otherwise, investors are not gonna find it valuable.
            * **You need one!**
            * Types (you should have one at least):
                * Founders [1 of 10 -in the world-]
                * Market [20% / year] (weak one)
                * Product [10x -better that competitors-]
                * Acquisition [$0 -cost to acquire new users-] (can‚Äôt count paid channels here!) (WOM is the best)
                * Monopoly [growth = harder for others to defeat you] ( growth of network = growth of company value, marketplaces where one company can win it)
          * (Good examples of unfair advantages in slides!)
* üë®‚Äçüíª Amazing talk overall. I think every one should watch it. Even if you don't currently have a startup idea.

### [How to Talk to Users](https://www.startupschool.org/videos/63)
* Good founders maintain a direct connection to their users. ( To extract info from your users throughout the different stages of a company )
* To start a company -according to YC- you need to:
    * Write code. (build your product)
    * Talk to users.
* The Mom Test:
    1. Talk about their life, _not your idea_. (extract data to help improve your product. not the time to sell your product to them)
    2. Talk specifics, _not hypotheticals_.
    3. Listen, _don‚Äôt talk_.
* Great questions you can ask in every user interview:
    1. What‚Äôs the hardest part about [doing this the thing]?
    2. Tell me about the last time you encountered that problem‚Ä¶ (context)
    3. Why was that hard? (To know how to explain the value to new customers) (Users buy the Why not the What)
    4. What, if anything, have you done to try to solve the problem? (is the problem burning enough for others to consider your solution. what your solution will be compared to)
    5. What don‚Äôt you love about the solution you‚Äôve tried? (basis of you feature set)
* Talking to users is useful at all stages:
    * Got idea? -> _find users with problem_
        * _Idea Stage_
            * Finding first users with problem:
                * Friends, coworkers, intros
                * Drop by in person!
                * Industry events
            * Tips:
                * Take detailed notes. (you never know which is useful until later)
                * Keep it casual. 
                * Careful with their time. (10-15 min max)
    * Built prototype -> _best first customers_ 
        * _Prototype Stage_
            * Identify best first customers
            * Find numerical answers to:
                * How much does this problem cost them?
                * How frequent is the problem?
                * How large is their budget?
    * Launched -> _find product market fit_
        * _Launched Stage_
            * Iterate towards Product Market Fit
            * Tips:
                * Ask for phone # during sign up.
                * Don‚Äôt design by committee.
                * Discard bad data. (complements)
* üë®‚Äçüíª Really liked how practical this talk was.

### [Week 1 Lectures Q&A](https://www.startupschool.org/videos/83)
#### WEEK 2
### [How to Plan an MVP](https://www.startupschool.org/videos/65)
* MVP (Minimum Viable Product): The first thing you can give to the first set of users to see if you can deliver any value to them.
* Talk to users before building any MVP -or writing any code-.
* Goal of any pre-launch startup:
    * Lunch quickly (MVP) [single most important info in this presentation is to launch something bad quickly].
    * Get initial customers.
    * Talk to customers and get feedback. [Hold your problem tightly, hold your customer tightly, hold the solution loosely]
    * Iterate (improve your product).
* Lean MVP (in most cases):
    * Very fast to build (Weeks not months)
    * Very limited functionality.
    * Appeal to a small set of users.
    * Base to iterated from.
*  Heavy MVP (in very few cases):
    * Significant regulations (insurance, banking)
    * Hardtech
    * Biotech
    * Moonshot
* Launch simply means to start getting customers.
* Learning from customers is easier with an MVP than without. (putting something in front of users to see if that solves their problem)
* Hacks for building an MVP quickly:
    * Timebox your spec 
    * Write your spec [To control change]
    * Cut your spec
    * Don‚Äôt fall in love with your MVP! [it‚Äôs just a first step in a journey]
* Q/A
    * Don‚Äôt ask users about features they want in your product, it‚Äôs your job to come up with features. Ask them about the problem itself, How frequent, intense? are they going to pay to solve it? do they know any other people who suffer from the same problem?
    * I‚Äôm stuck in the cycle where I keep changing the MVP and never launch? Stop doing what you are doing. Stop seeing your MVP as special, it doesn‚Äôt have to be perfect.
    * Key-value of MVP? To see whether your solution is solving the problem.
    * Don‚Äôt solve the problem for all users.
    * There are a lot of times where a founder has to keep two things in mind at the same time: Vision big and MVP small. Grow and Retain. Investor pitch and Customer pitch. Founders always wanna smoosh these things together or kill one because it‚Äôs much easier to think of it as a single problem.
* üë®‚Äçüíª Great solutions for common mistakes.
