#### WEEK 1
### [Startup School 2019 Orientation](https://www.startupschool.org/videos/82)
### [How to Evaluate Startup Ideas Pt. 1](https://www.startupschool.org/videos/62)
* Startup = Growth
* A great investor will not try to poke holes in your idea, instead will try to find a way for that to become a billion dollars idea. ( A great investor will pitch your idea back to you, and try to convince you on ways to grow your company fast )
* Your startup idea is a hypothesis. Your job is to figure out how to construct this hypothesis (the pitch) to the investors so they understand how it can grow quickly. ( A common mistake is to accurately describe or over-describe different parts)
* Startup Idea:
    * **Problem**: What are the initial conditions (settings) for this company that allow it to grow quickly.
        * Good characteristics of a problem ( ways to describe your problem ):
            * Popular [1M+ users]
            * Growing -markets- [20%/ year]
            * Urgent [people have to solve it **Right Now**]
            * Expensive -to solve- [cost $B]
            * Mandatory [Laws changed]
            * frequent (very important) [Hourly] 
    * **Solution**: What is the experiment that you are running for this company to grow quickly.
        * **Don‚Äôt start here!**
            * Avoid -> SISP "Solutions In Search of a Problem‚Äù ( usually engineers get excited about a technology and tend to build something with it and then try to find a problem to solve with this solution )
    * **Insight**: Why your experiment is going to be successful.
        * **Unfair advantage.**
            * Why this solution is going to work? 
            * Why you are going to win vs everyone else?
            * Why should the investor choose you over anyone else?
            * **Related to growth.**
                * Your unfair advantage should be related to growth, otherwise, investors are not gonna find it valuable.
            * **You need one!**
            * Types (you should have one at least):
                * Founders [1 of 10 -in the world-]
                * Market [20% / year] (weak one)
                * Product [10x -better that competitors-]
                * Acquisition [$0 -cost to acquire new users-] (can‚Äôt count paid channels here!) (WOM is the best)
                * Monopoly [growth = harder for others to defeat you] ( growth of network = growth of company value, marketplaces where one company can win it)
          * (Good examples of unfair advantages in slides!)
* üë®‚Äçüíª Amazing talk overall. I think every one should watch it. Even if you don't currently have a startup idea.

### [How to Talk to Users](https://www.startupschool.org/videos/63)
* Good founders maintain a direct connection to their users. ( To extract info from your users throughout the different stages of a company )
* To start a company -according to YC- you need to:
    * Write code. (build your product)
    * Talk to users.
* The Mom Test:
    1. Talk about their life, _not your idea_. (extract data to help improve your product. not the time to sell your product to them)
    2. Talk specifics, _not hypotheticals_.
    3. Listen, _don‚Äôt talk_.
* Great questions you can ask in every user interview:
    1. What‚Äôs the hardest part about [doing this the thing]?
    2. Tell me about the last time you encountered that problem‚Ä¶ (context)
    3. Why was that hard? (To know how to explain the value to new customers) (Users buy the Why not the What)
    4. What, if anything, have you done to try to solve the problem? (is the problem burning enough for others to consider your solution. what your solution will be compared to)
    5. What don‚Äôt you love about the solution you‚Äôve tried? (basis of you feature set)
* Talking to users is useful at all stages:
    * Got idea? -> _find users with problem_
        * _Idea Stage_
            * Finding first users with problem:
                * Friends, coworkers, intros
                * Drop by in person!
                * Industry events
            * Tips:
                * Take detailed notes. (you never know which is useful until later)
                * Keep it casual. 
                * Careful with their time. (10-15 min max)
    * Built prototype -> _best first customers_ 
        * _Prototype Stage_
            * Identify best first customers
            * Find numerical answers to:
                * How much does this problem cost them?
                * How frequent is the problem?
                * How large is their budget?
    * Launched -> _find product market fit_
        * _Launched Stage_
            * Iterate towards Product Market Fit
            * Tips:
                * Ask for phone # during sign up.
                * Don‚Äôt design by committee.
                * Discard bad data. (complements)
* üë®‚Äçüíª Really liked how practical this talk was.

### [Week 1 Lectures Q&A](https://www.startupschool.org/videos/83)
#### WEEK 2
### [How to Plan an MVP](https://www.startupschool.org/videos/65)
* MVP (Minimum Viable Product): The first thing you can give to the first set of users to see if you can deliver any value to them.
* Talk to users before building any MVP -or writing any code-.
* Goal of any pre-launch startup:
    * Lunch quickly (MVP) [single most important info in this presentation is to launch something bad quickly].
    * Get initial customers.
    * Talk to customers and get feedback. [Hold your problem tightly, hold your customer tightly, hold the solution loosely]
    * Iterate (improve your product).
* Lean MVP (in most cases):
    * Very fast to build (Weeks not months)
    * Very limited functionality.
    * Appeal to a small set of users.
    * Base to iterated from.
*  Heavy MVP (in very few cases):
    * Significant regulations (insurance, banking)
    * Hardtech
    * Biotech
    * Moonshot
* Launch simply means to start getting customers.
* Learning from customers is easier with an MVP than without. (putting something in front of users to see if that solves their problem)
* Hacks for building an MVP quickly:
    * Timebox your spec 
    * Write your spec [To control change]
    * Cut your spec
    * Don‚Äôt fall in love with your MVP! [it‚Äôs just a first step in a journey]
* Q/A
    * Don‚Äôt ask users about features they want in your product, it‚Äôs your job to come up with features. Ask them about the problem itself, How frequent, intense? are they going to pay to solve it? do they know any other people who suffer from the same problem?
    * I‚Äôm stuck in the cycle where I keep changing the MVP and never launch? Stop doing what you are doing. Stop seeing your MVP as special, it doesn‚Äôt have to be perfect.
    * Key-value of MVP? To see whether your solution is solving the problem.
    * Don‚Äôt solve the problem for all users.
    * There are a lot of times where a founder has to keep two things in mind at the same time: Vision big and MVP small. Grow and Retain. Investor pitch and Customer pitch. Founders always wanna smoosh these things together or kill one because it‚Äôs much easier to think of it as a single problem.
* üë®‚Äçüíª Great solutions for common mistakes.

### [How to Set KPIs and Goals](https://www.startupschool.org/videos/64)
* KPI (Key Performance Indicator): A set of quantitative metrics that indicate how healthy your business is doing.
    * Primary metric: The one metric that if you had to you would bet the whole company on.
        * Why only one metric? To focus and keep it simple. 
        * The job of this metric? To quickly determine how well your startup is doing.
        * Characteristics of a good primary metric:
            * Represent delivery of real value
            * Capture recurring value
            * Lagging indicator (users gave out money of time to use your product)
            * Usable as a feedback mechanism.
        * Revenue: Nothing can tell more about delivering value than revenue. suits 99% of startups. usually MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)
        * Active Users: When your startup is network based (Advertising business model like facebook). Huge network effect (e.g. Marketplace: where you need users for it to get going)
    *  Secondary metrics: (3-5 north stars metrics, where you choose along with a primary one to get 360¬∞ overview of the health of your company)
* Goals: set weekly % growth rate (weekly because you need frequent feedback from users and to divide the progress you need into doable chunks)
    * Do things that don‚Äôt scale to achieve your weekly goal. Don‚Äôt worry too much about the final goal.
    * Guidelines on defining a goal:
        * Fast initial growth (usually growth gets slow after some time)
        * Time to sale (how long does it take to acquire a user and make a sale)
        * Organic vs paid (Focus on organic [WOM, search engines]. using paid users in the beginning is cheating growth)
        * Exponential vs linear
* How to leverage your primary metric and goal?
    * Week to wee stack rank all the ideas you have of how to grow. and choose what would have the biggest impact on meeting your next week's goal)
* Q/A
    * LTV (Customer lifetime value) should not be paired with CAC (Customer acquisition cost). When you are focused on paid growth look at payback period (0 days?).
### [Analytics for Startups](https://www.startupschool.org/videos/84)
* Why analytics and data?
    1. Test product market fit.
    2. Focus the team.
    3. Operate/grow the company.
* Funnels: Sequential series of steps your users go through to actually get value and then pay you.
    * Typical funnel for B2B and B2C companies: you __acquire__ a user, __engage__ him over a period of time (this loop is called __retention__) and then __monetize__ him.
    * Metrics both primary and secondary are performance indicators on top of each stage in the funnel.
        1.  On top of Acquisition: How many signups this week vs last?
            * Signups per week
        2. On top of Engagement: How many users are re-engaged week over week?
            * Retention cohorts
                * Which metric do you pick? a metrics that represent value (Airbnb -> Bookings, Uber -> rides)
                * 
        3. On top of Monetize: How much revenue are we making week over week?
            * Revenue
* Stack over time: 
    * 
    * Open as much communication channels with your customers as you can.
    * [10:07 -> 13:18 must watch if interested)
* Best in class tools:
    * Improving product usability:
        * [fullstory](https://www.fullstory.com/): to watch how users interact with your product.
        * Small usability issues might drive metrics down!
    * 43-min founder email:
        * [customer.io](https://cutomer.io): you can specify a certain amount time to send an email from founders after user signup.
        * A way to start the connection between you and the users.
    * Democratize data access:
        * [Google big query and Mode](https://mode.com/big-query/): to find answers to questions normal data analytics tools can‚Äôt answer.
        * Good after PMF stage.
    * Tools change -every 2 years-, don‚Äôt overthink which tool to choose. Just pick one and set your self up for change.
* A nice gift for early-stage startups! checkout slide 36.
* üë®‚Äçüíª Very practical talk. Recommend it to after MVP stage startups.

### [How Investors Measure Startups Q&A](https://www.startupschool.org/videos/85)
*  How investors measure startups at early stages?
    * Team (Most important) (Why your are working on this idea? your clarity of thought? How good are you with convincing others? If an investor gives you capital you know what to do with it?) 
    * Product market fit
    * Market opportunity 
* When to fundraise?
    1. You need the money to grow
    2. You are willing to give up equity to grow
    3. You clearly know the milestone this money will get your company

#### WEEK 4
### [How to Launch (Repeatedly)](https://www.startupschool.org/videos/68)
* Why launch constantly?
    * A/B test your short pitch
    * See how users respond to your product
    * Launching to different audiences: Are you talking to the right users?
* Types of launches:
    * Silent Launch (you can use [ship](https://www.producthunt.com/ship) or [carrd](https://carrd.co)
        * Domain name
        * Company name
        * Short description

    * Online Communities
        * Reddit
        * Hackernews

        * For physical products.
    * New product/feature
        * Pressing every launch button with new products/features
    * Build your own community
        * Email list (add people interested in your product to a mailing list and send updates every once in a while. When launching your product ask them to help spreading the word about it)
* Launching is not a one moment in time.
* üë®‚ÄçüíªGood talk. Lots of interesting stories and good ideas. 
### [Growth for Startups](https://www.startupschool.org/videos/69)
* Most startups don‚Äôt have PMF. Founders convince them selfs they do, but they don‚Äôt üòû 
* If you build it, they _won‚Äôt_ come! (people are used to working on big companies where this isn‚Äôt a problem!)
* As a founder you must keep in mind these two skills:
    * At the beginning of your company, you will do so many things that don‚Äôt feel right. Physical and real stuff that don‚Äôt feel relevant later on.
    * When your company grows bigger, you are gonna do things that relate directly to software, that scale your company.
* One way to grow when you are small: Doing things that don‚Äôt scale.
*  PMF:
    * How to know if you‚Äôve reached PMF?
        1. Identify the __metric__ that represent the value my users get from my product.
        2. Measure the repeat usage of that metric
    *  Other (worse) ways to measure PMF:
        1. Net promoter score - not great
        2. Surveys - often biased
        3. "How would you feel if you can no longer use this product"
    * Other not good metrics for PMF:
        1. Registered users
        2. Visitors
        3. ‚ÄúConversion rate"
        4. ‚ÄúCustomers that aren‚Äôt paying"
* Growth channels & tactics (Don‚Äôt do this before PMF. There‚Äôs no need for this with users that churn so fast):
    1. Product growth / conversion rate optimization (engineers, designers, data scientists, product managers)
        1. Your product is a funnel/growth loop
        2. Every step in the funnel have drop-off
            * Content/Copy
            * Internationalization
            * Authentication (critical flow/ users are vulnerable)
            * On-boarding
            * Purchase conversion 
    2. Growth channels
        * rare behavior/ people use google to find a solution? -> Google SEO & SEM
            * SEO:
                * On-page optimization:
                    * Every optimization starts with keyword research.
                    * Which page am I trying to rank for that keyword?
                    * SEO experimentation
                * Off-page optimization:
                    * Who is linking to you? (More link from press and blogs will get you higher)
        * do current users already share your product via word-of-mouth? (Uber, Airbnb) -> Virality & Referrals
            * Referrals:
                * WOM is Airbnb‚Äôs largest growth driver
                * Referrals are engineered WOM.
        * Does having more users improve the experience? (Marketplaces, LinkedIn, facebook) -> Virality
        * Do I already know who each of my future users is? -> Sales
        * Do my users have high LTV? -> Paid acquisition (Google, facebook)
            * Pain Growth:
                * Don‚Äôt do paid growth if you don‚Äôt have revenue (common mistake)
                * CAC = Customer acquisition cost
                * CAC / Payback time (the most important metric in online marketing)
                * Channels: Google, facebook, Appstore and play store for apps.
        * Most companies grow huge using 1 or 2 of these channels!
* Making decisions using A/B testing:
    * Most startups at early stages don‚Äôt need A/B testing, it won‚Äôt matter at all. It‚Äôs a great decision making tool later on.
    * A/B test calculator (Search on google)
* Summary:
    1. Start by doing things that don‚Äôt scale
    2. Measure your retention / PMF
    3. Build a culture of experimentation (use data to make decisions and not follow the loudest sound in the room)

#### WEEK 5
### [Startup Finance Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them](https://www.startupschool.org/videos/70)

* It‚Äôs surprisingly easy to run out of cash.
* Not knowing what numbers to look at (to ensure the health of your company finically)
    * Know this:
        * Bank balance
        * Money coming in
        * Money going out
    * Calculate this:
        * Burn -> Money in - Money out
        * Runway (# of months till you run out of money) -> Bank balance / Average burn
        * Growth rate -> Money in (Month 2) - Money in (Month 1) / Money in (Month 1)
        * Default alive? -> if (expenses = constant) && if (revenue growth = continues): [Do you have enough cash to reach profitability?] [startup growth calculator](https://growth.tlb.org) [Default alive or default dead?](https://paulgraham.com/aord.html)
* Not looking too often (you should look at it every week)
* Under-representing expenses:
    * Expenses don‚Äôt remain constant:
        * undervaluing your own time
        * Hiring people doesn‚Äôt just cost their salary (equipments, health insurance, office space)
        * Assuming paid acquisition remain constant (in the early days you might find users who are excited to use your product, and over time it gets harder to find and convert users. Assume and predict the worst case scenario so you can manage it well)
        * Don‚Äôt ignore to make runway look good! (numbers don‚Äôt lie and money will finish eventually)
* Out-sourcing responsibility:
    * It‚Äôs recommended to outsource bookkeeping and focus on what really matters. But at the same time you as a founder/CEO are the one responsible for the numbers.
* Scaling too quickly:
    * It‚Äôs easy to fall in this pitfall.
    * The best startups do more with less.
    * You should avoid hiring before PMF.
    * More employees do not help you reach PMF.
* Letting runway get too low before fundraising:
    * Always assume you‚Äôll never raise money again.
    * Seed stage money will help you reach PMF.
    * Series A and beyond expect sustained growth.
    * Your runway gives you leverage.
    * [Advice for Companies With Less Than 1 Year of Runway](https://blog.ycombinator.com/advice-startups-running-out-of-money/)
* How to not run out of money?
    * Know your cash balance and runway at all times.
    * Understand how your expenses are going to increase over time.
    * Understand that a high ration of revenue: employees is a better metric than # of employees.
    * Assume you‚Äôll never raise again, so have a plan for reaching profitability.


### [How to Work Together](https://www.startupschool.org/videos/71)

* Founders need to optimize a relationship that can last for 10 years.
*  The four horsemen (To avoid when fighting):
    * Criticism (not addressing the one issue in hand, instead, bringing other issues to the conversation)
    * Contempt (intention to insult)
    * Defensiveness (someone not owning responsibility to the problem)
    * Stonewalling (not engaging, not talking)
* Make a plan before you fight:
    * Divide and conquer (who‚Äôs responsible/decision maker for what ex: finance, product, hiring)
    * Once you decide ownership -> determine success and failure. (what can trigger conversation and serious talk when things go south)
    * Know your self:
        * What‚Äôs your attachment style (How people approach relationships):
            * Secure (don‚Äôt mind been vulnerable, relying on each other)
            * Anxious (want to feel loved all the time)
            * Avoidant (it‚Äôs scary, and i‚Äôm afraid I will ruin it up)
        * What‚Äôs your cofounder's attachment style?
            * Anxious(need constant validation to make decisions/solve conflicts ) and Avoidant (need space to make decisions/resolve conflicts) are the most common in the world!
        * [What Is Your Attachment Style?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s9ACDMcpjA)
    * Document a process
        * When you are emotionally sober, make a process to deal with disagreements.

        * There are a lot of ways. You just all have to agree ahead of time.
    * Use non violent communication
        * Nonviolent communication (Book). ‚ÄúWhen [observation], I feel [emotion] because I‚Äôm needing some [universal needs]. Would you be able to [request]?"
        * Observation vs Evaluation (disagreement/criticism should about an observation(You haven‚Äôt finished this task for a week) , not an evaluation/opinion (you are lazy!)
        * Emotion vs Thoughts (don‚Äôt say thoughts talk about feelings) (I feel frustrated / I think you are not taking this seriously) (to know if this is a feeling or a thought, is to substitute the phrase I think with I feel and it still  works)
        * Universal needs
            * (I need to be CCde in every email you send! - instead use a universal need - I need transparency! ) 
            * Everybody can agree on universal needs.
            * Avoid (I need support **from you**) since this makes it non universal.
        * Requests vs Needs
            * Requests an invitation for the other poison to meet our universal needs.
            * Make it very specific.
            * Say what you want (not what you don‚Äôt want).
            * Stay curious.

    * Pay down your emotional debt
        * Pay this down every day.
        * In successful relationships: you don‚Äôt resolve big conflicts, you resolve the conflict when it‚Äôs small and you don‚Äôt let it grow ever.
    * Practice having level 3 conversations:
        * Level 1: Informal conversation/ data exchange
        * Level 2: have some emotions/talk about something personal
        * Level 3: They are relational/ they are engaged with something that is happening right now, something that matter. (In a startup there are a lot of things that matter and should be talked about)
* Questions to start with:
    * Goals:
        * What are our short term goals for the company?
        * Are we using the right metrics?
        * Are we hitting our goals?
    * Roles:
        * Is it clear who is responsible for what?
        * Do we agree that the current division makes the most sense?
    * Performance:
        * Is our workload distributed in an optimal manner today?
        * Do we all feel a high level of dedication and motivation?

    * Start having hard conversations now.
    * Use non violent communications to share honest feedback without criticism.
    * Pay down emotions debt regularly.

#### WEEK 6
### [Building Culture](https://www.startupschool.org/videos/72)

* Culture is behavior. Implicit set of behaviors inside your company. They should inform the employees how to behave if it hasn‚Äôt been explicitly laid out for them.
* Right behaviors -> Good business
* Stages of companies: Idea stage ->  PMF -> Scaling
* The (~20) employees before scaling are the DNA of your companies culture.
* 6 thing you can do now:
    1. Be proud of the problem you are solving.
    2. Create a long time vision that others will follow.
        * Tesla: To accelerate the world‚Äôs transition to sustainable energy.
        * Microsoft: A computer on every desk and in every home.
        * Google: Organize the world‚Äôs information and make it universally accruable and useful.
    3. List your values then model the behavior.
        * Spotify:
            * Innovative
            * Collaborative
            * Sincere
            * Passionate
            * Playful
            * Innovative
        * Atlassian:
            * Open company, no bullshit.
            * Build with heart and balance.
            * Don't #@!% the customer.
            * Play, as a team.
            * Be the change you seek.
    4. Align your culture with your customer.
        * Examples of internally-focused culture:
            * Facebook‚Äôs "Move fast and break things‚Äù.
            * Googls‚Äôs ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be evil‚Äù.
            * 
    5. Talk about the importance of diversity to your company.
        * Diversity of opinions. (Very important)
    6. Put a hiring process into practice, plan to evolve it.
* It‚Äôs not too early to start today!

### [All About Pivoting](https://www.startupschool.org/videos/73)

* What is a pivot?
    * Changing your product.
* A company that is not quickly ideating and rapidly learning and changing in the beginning is probably not moving fast enough.
* Opportunity lost: ‚Äúthe loss of the potential gain from other alternatives when one alternative is chosen."
* Good reasons to pivot:
    * I hate working on it.
    * It‚Äôs not growing.
    * I‚Äôm not a good fit to be working on this idea.
    * I‚Äôm relying on an external factor outside of my control to make my startup take off.
    * I‚Äôm out of ideas on what to do differently to make it start working.
* Good reasons **not** to pivot:
    * You are trying to run away from doing hard work.
    * You are repeatedly changing ideas and giving up on them before launching and doing sales.
    * You read an article about some hot new trend that is popular with investors and want to chase it.
* Why people take too long to pivot?
    * Loss aversion (when feel you have invested a lot in something and have a hard time letting go.
    * Have a little bit of attraction.
    * People are very polite and have a hard time telling you they don‚Äôt like the thing you are working on.
    * Fear of admitting weakness/defeat.
    * Putting blame re:why things aren‚Äôt working on customers/investors.
    * Belief given to you by inspirational sources that ‚Äúif you believe hard enough things are going to change‚Äù
* Reminder about product market fit
    * Most people never get it
    * You know you have it when growth is not your biggest problem ‚Äî keeping up with demand is.
    * If you don‚Äôt have PMF and you have given an idea your best then it can be easier to get PMF by changing ideas than continuing to throw good time/money after bad.
    * ‚Äúshots on goal"
* How to find a better idea:
    * Try to find something the founders are more excited about and makes them feel more optimistic to work on it.
    * Corollary: being more ambitious is often counter-intuitively easier.
    * Honest assessment of founders strengths/weaknesses and attempt to find something with better founder make-fit.
    * Best to find something easy to get started and validate market feedback.
    * It OK to work on an idea that doesn‚Äôt require VC:
        * Most companies in the world that people start don‚Äôt require VC. That‚Äôs good.
        * Trying to raise money for a company where VC doesn‚Äôt make sense is not a great use of anyone's time.
        * If the way you evaluate the quality of an idea is from investors you are going to get pushed down the VC rabbit hole.
* When is the best time to pivot?
    * ASAP when these things happen:
        * You have launched and have been trying to get users for weeks or months and it feels hopeless.
        * When the idea is impossible to get started on b/c it takes years of building/too much capital etc.
        * You know in your heart its not going to work.
* More pivoting thoughts:
    * Pivoting over and over and over again can cause whiplash.
        * Whiplash makes founders give up -> kills the company.
    * Founders that are incapable of changing ideas struggle, founders that change ideas too much struggle. Find the happy medium.
    * Having employees while pivoting is extra hard and not recommended ‚Äî best to do it with just founders.
* Idea quality scores:
    * How big of an idea it seems to be: 1-10
    * Founder/market fit: 1-10
    * How easy is it to get started on the idea: 1-10
    * Early market feedback from the customers: 1-10
    * Overall score: 0-10
*  Summary:
    * Changing your idea is part of doing a startup, and the earlier you lock into the right ideas the better.
    * When you are considering a pivot it should not feel like some huge monumental decision.
    * You should follow pivoting best practices.

#### WEEK 7
### [How to Improve Conversion Rates](https://www.startupschool.org/videos/74)

* Working on churn is easier than working on conversion.
* To solve design (UI) problems:
    *  You either have to do one of each -> decrease knowledge || increase knowledge.
    * For landing pages do the one button exercise: if I have only one button in a page and I want users to click it. What information should I put in there to make them click it? and what information I need to remove that makes them not click it?
* 7 questions to ask your self to improve conversion rates:
    * What‚Äôs the call to action? (a button to click that should be right beside the Magic Moment ‚Äúthe moment your user understands and feels the most excited about your product‚Äù)
    * What is it? (the magic moment it might be a sentence that could be put in an email and sent to your mom and she will understand the product )
    * Is it right for me? (am I in the right place? Is there any reflection in this of me?)
    * Is it legit? (normal template would solve this. don‚Äôt overthink it)
    * Who else is using it? (it‚Äôs a short cut for the previous two questions. If so and so are using it, I might give it a chance)
    * How much is it? What‚Äôs the catch? (have some empathy and show how much it costs)
    * Where can I get help? (FAQ are not enough. People wanna talk to someone or at least know that they can talk to someone)

### [Startup Pricing 101](https://www.startupschool.org/videos/75)

* 1% of effort in optimizing monetization might give you up to 12.7% in growth. Compared to the 1% in Acquisition will give you 3.32% and in retention the 1% will give you 6.71%.
* <img src="https://uc3292f596a2b81ed485c867a229.previews.dropboxusercontent.com/p/pdf_img/AAiBhO2Qq-ObTQ-46XRvBxVqptb2QKtRxN3hO7ykXX7bzDzibzC5TOMbaGithZDbSQ83wwPZJVNhR3LP2KcZilFC8NGgeTX2SJGA84WYug85k3T0GUYcwvl9Un0JBPqJEBVSNOaEVo3L577_YcUvYLGdG97WKFSzyYKjUU_WVoZt5VsJKIjEKpIGkzHNEHaCz96eacehdDD22xhOqu2B7XeMan30uOZZV8S21I3h-5dKwQ1jk7Q-9RNn0ijFjol8gF1c_q3cNPTJYSl87bt0ciI2fS2Akth_Yd4ykBloL6mLy160oozOt-I6EjOAQ2Hy1mq0p1K-YHGBvCJTROgdArRFeDoP_MguFF9Zt4lgaIpLsdxOiRZgirCajoVeeIwyATY/p.png?page=3&scale_percent=0" width="350" />
* Companies that don‚Äôt price the product with neither "value based pricing‚Äù nor ‚Äúcost plus‚Äù models will face one or more of these mistakes:
    * **Prices are too low.**
    * **Underestimate you cost.** (your margins are not enough to cover acquisition)
    * **Don‚Äôt understand your value.** (you don‚Äôt understand your value, or you don‚Äôt know how to convince users of the value your product provide)
    * Focus on the wrong customers
* Demand doesn‚Äôt accelerate until the first 2% to 5% of potential buyers adopt the product.
* Why is pricing innovation hard?
    * Innovations requires users to change patterns.
    * Average user lacks knowledge and trust to make that change.
    * Early adopters place highest value on potential benefits.
* 10 - 5 - 20 Rule:
    * Value = 10x Price
    * Raise price 5%
    * Until 20% push back
* Summary:
    * Pricing gives the most bang for effort
    * Understand the variables (const, price, value)
    * Go after early adopters. Benefit > Price
    * Get organized when optimizing pricing.
    * Price determines acquisition strategy
    * Use the 10 / 5 / 20 Rule

        * Airbnb is the first online marketplace that lets travelers book rooms with locals, instead of hotels.
        * Dropbox synchronizes files across your/your team‚Äôs computers.
        * Vahan is building LinkedIn to the next billion internet users.
            * Should I use x for y?
                * X is a household name
                * Does Y want X?
                * Y should be a huge market
