#### WEEK 1
### [Startup School 2019 Orientation](https://www.startupschool.org/videos/82)
### [How to Evaluate Startup Ideas Pt. 1](https://www.startupschool.org/videos/62)
* Startup = Growth
* A great investor will not try to poke holes in your idea, instead will try to find a way for that to become a billion dollars idea. ( A great investor will pitch your idea back to you, and try to convince you on ways to grow your company fast )
* Your startup idea is a hypothesis. Your job is to figure out how to construct this hypothesis (the pitch) to the investors so they understand how it can grow quickly. ( A common mistake is to accurately describe or over-describe different parts)
* Startup Idea:
    * **Problem**: What is the initial conditions (settings) for this company that allows it to grow quickly.
        * Good characteristics of a problem ( ways to describe your problem ):
            * Popular [1M+ users]
            * Growing -markets- [20%/ year]
            * Urgent [people have to solve it **Right Now**]
            * Expensive -to solve- [cost $B]
            * Mandatory [Laws changed]
            * frequent (very important) [Hourly] 
    * **Solution**: What is the experiment that you are running for this company to grow quickly.
        * **Don‚Äôt start here!**
            * Avoid -> SISP "Solutions In Search of a Problem‚Äù ( usually engineers get excited about a technology and tend to build something with it and then try to find a problem to solve with this solution )
    * **Insight**: Why your experiment is going to be successful.
        * **Unfair advantage.**
            * Why this solution is going to work? 
            * Why you are going to win vs everyone else?
            * Why should the investor choose you over anyone else?
            * **Related to growth.**
                * Your unfair advantage should be related to growth, otherwise, investors are not gonna find it valuable.
            * **You need one!**
            * Types (you should have one at least):
                * Founders [1 of 10 -in the world-]
                * Market [20% / year] (weak one)
                * Product [10x -better that competitors-]
                * Acquisition [$0 -cost to acquire new users-] (can‚Äôt count paid channels here!) (WOM is the best)
                * Monopoly [growth = harder for others to defeat you] ( growth of network = growth of company value, marketplaces where one company can win it)
          * (Good examples of unfair advantages in slides!)
* üë®‚Äçüíª Amazing talk overall. I think every one should watch it. Even if you don't currently have a startup idea.
